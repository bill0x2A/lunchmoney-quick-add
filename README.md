# Quick-Add

Quick Add (soon-to-be milk money) is an easy way to add cash transaction to lunchmoney via your developer token.

There's some stuff to do:

1. Make this a PWA
1. Turn on strict type checking
1. Actually save the most-used (no concept) or favorited (concept exists, we add to state after selection) categories in localStorage
1. Audit for best PWA practices
1. Color audit
1. Button audit

(And when I say audit, I mean, like, how can this be better.)
