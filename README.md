# Quick-Add

Quick Add (soon-to-be milk money) is an easy way to add cash transaction to lunchmoney via your developer token.

There's some stuff to do:

1. Allow people to add their dev token to let the app work: localStorage
2. Get negative/positive switching up and running
3. if no access token and no categories, don't show loading
4. more
